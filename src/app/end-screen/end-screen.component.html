    <p>The Journey to Haven was fraught with many dangers. Perhaps you had a deadly encounter with creatures such as the Horned-Riat or Ro-Quid. Or perhaps you died at the hands of bandits trying to steal your crystals. Hopefully you weren't done in by a tiny Rolling-Urchin.  May You Rest in Peace. </p>

  <h1>Game Over</h1>
    <p>As the next day dawns, you watch the sunrise to the east. Perhaps this is the day you reach Haven.  Your optimism vanishes the moment you see shapes starting to appear in the horizon. First one, the two, five, fifteen, fifty too many to count. The horde had arrived.  You run into the transport telling the driver to floor it. The engine roars to life as the transport begins to speed away, one of you companions gets on the mounted turret to repel any damned 'Coyote that came close. Within minutes you hear the sounds of turret fire disappear. You go to pull her down from the turret, only to find a hole in her chest.  You yell for someone to get on the gun, but your command is drowned out by the noise of the engine sputtering, until it too falls silent. Slowly the transport start to lose speed. In a horrific silence you realize that this was the end. Would you kneel down and wait for death, or would you die fighting? This was the only choice left for you to make.</p>

  <h1>You Won!</h1>
    <p>Overcoming the threats posed by wildlife, bandits, and everything else on this damned planet, you and your companions reach Haven.  Compared to the small settlement you once called home, you are overwhelmed by the sights. The outskirts covered in dwellings of stone and wood, but as you travel towards the city center the builds become made of steel, and stone. After passing through the city center you see something you have never seen before in your lifetime, the ocean. Haven was said to be a place of diversity, a place where one could start over, judging by all of the various Beast-Folk and humans simply going about their lives, it seemed to be true.  </p>

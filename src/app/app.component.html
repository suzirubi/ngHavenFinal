    <div class="instructions">
      <p>Haven is a resource management and survival game in the same vein as The Oregon Trail. The goal of the game is to reach Haven safely, before a horde of humanoid coyotes with a penchant for violence, and unquenchable bloodlust catches up to you. During your travels, you must manage your crystals (energy) and HP (health) to ensure you reach Haven. Along the way, you will be met by many encounters that affect your resources and travel plans.</p>
      <p>Your main actions are travel, gather, rest, or heal.<br><br>
      <strong>Travel moves you closer to Haven, but spends a day and 20 crystals.</strong><br><br>
      <strong>Gather increases your crystals, and takes a full day.</strong><br><br>
      <strong>Rest heals your HP by a small amount and costs you 1 day.</strong><br><br>
      <strong>Heal recovers your HP, but costs 30 crystals.</strong><br><br>


      <p>Your <strong>HP</strong> is the amount of damage your are able to take. If you reach 0 HP at any point, you lose the game.</p>
      <p>Your <strong>Crystals</strong> are spent whenever you expend energy. Traveling, gathering, and healing all use crystals.</p>
      <p>Your <strong>Speed</strong>, <strong>Healing</strong>, and <strong>Gathering</strong> are your attributes.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Speed affects the distance you move per travel action.</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Healing affects the amount of HP you recover while using the rest action or the heal action.</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Gathering affects the amount of crystals you gain while using the gather action.</strong><br><br>
      <strong>Your Max HP is the amount of HP you can have. You cannot go over your Max HP.</strong><br><br>

      <p>Along the way, you will encounter landmarks that allow you to increase one of your stats by 1. Choose wisely!</p>

  <h2>Welcome to Haven</h2>

  <p>After the establishment of New Arc, and the Exodus that followed, the Central  Wasteland erupted into chaos. Gangs of humans, and beast folk alike started attacking settlements for their own greedy purposes. Those were the the lucky towns, others were destroyed without mercy, without reason. Then came that one fateful night...</p>

  <p>By your determination to live, or perhaps sheer dumb luck, you survived the chaos that destroyed your home. As a new day dawns a traveler driving a beat up looking military transport passed through what was left of you home. Surprised to see anyone alive he stopped to greet you.</p>

  <p>“Dammit it all! Town after town I come to, each one of them has been reduced to nothing but rubble. The whole damn ‘Waste has gone crazy!” He paused to take a glance around him, noticing other survivors coming out of the rubble. “Yet, you folks are the first survivors I’ve found.  Listen, if you can pull your own weight, you can tag along with me to Haven!”</p>

  <p>“Haven?” you ask.</p>

  <p>“Haven is the last great city in the Central Wastes! Now gather what things your have left. We need to get moving. There is a horde of ‘Coyotes with weapons, insatiable bloodlust gathering to the west fifty miles from here, and we don’t want to draw their attention!</p>

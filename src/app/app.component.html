  <h2>Welcome to Haven</h2>

  <p>After the establishment of New Arc, and the Exodus that followed, the Central  Wasteland erupted into chaos. Gangs of humans, and beast folk alike started attacking settlements for their own greedy purposes. Those were the the lucky towns, others were destroyed without mercy, without reason. Then came that one fateful night...</p>

  <p>By your determination to live, or perhaps sheer dumb luck, you survived the chaos that destroyed your home. As a new day dawns a traveler driving a beat up looking military transport passed through what was left of you home. Surprised to see anyone alive he stopped to greet you.</p>

  <p>“Dammit it all! Town after town I come to, each one of them has been reduced to nothing but rubble. The whole damn ‘Waste has gone crazy!” He paused to take a glance around him, noticing other survivors coming out of the rubble. “Yet, you folks are the first survivors I’ve found.  Listen, if you can pull your own weight, you can tag along with me to Haven!”</p>

  <p>“Haven?” you ask.</p>

  <p>“Haven is the last great city in the Central Wastes! Now gather what things your have left. We need to get moving. There is a horde of ‘Coyotes with weapons, insatiable bloodlust gathering to the west fifty miles from here, and we don’t want to draw their attention!</p>
